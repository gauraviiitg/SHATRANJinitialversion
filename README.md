The project "SHATRANJ" is an AI-based checkers trainer developed from March to May 2023. It utilizes Pygames, Python, Bootstrap, and Artificial Intelligence techniques to create an intelligent trainer for the game of checkers. The key highlight of the project is the implementation of an improved alpha-beta pruning algorithm, which enables efficient decision-making. Extensive testing and evaluation involving 300 matches demonstrated an impressive win rate of 93.2 percent against human players. The trainer's performance is further enhanced through reinforcement learning, allowing it to learn from its mistakes and successes in previous games. Currently, SHATRANJ is successfully employed by Kendriya Vidyalaya, Panvel, providing a practical and real-life implementation of the project.
